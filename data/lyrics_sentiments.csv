There were bells on a hill
But I never heard them ringing
No, I never heard them at all
Till there was you

There were birds in the sky
But I never saw them winging
No, I never saw them at all
Till there was you

Then there was music and wonderful roses
They tell me in sweet fragrant meadows
Of dawn and dew

There was love all around
But I never heard it singing
No, I never heard it at all

And I'm standing on a platform
Now I'm staring from a train
And all the trees roll back beside but I'm so oblivious
To the dark to the light
It's all the same

You gave me so much
And now it's of the earth

And it makes me cry
It can makes me cry

And you're standing here beside me
In a picture in a frame
And your voice could never fade it's so familiar
Things you said in my head
Every day

You gave me so much
And now it's of the earth

And it makes me cry
It can makes me cry


You're with me so much
Through you're never with me anymore

And it makes me cry

With your winter clothes, your broken sandal straps
I love to see you naked over there

Katrinah Josephina is no longer, so they say
She disappeared one year ago and not a trace remains
All the theories are just hearsay as to why she disappeared
Some say she was abducted, and some say she drowned in fear
And what a joy it is to be the only one who knows
Katrinah Josephina journeys ninety leagues below

She's singing the praises of angels and sages
Oh, when the pills wear off, the symptoms will return
You may have found relief the cause has still yet to be learned

As a child, she was quite mystified in searching for the soul
With spade in hand, she soon began to dig a little hole
At one league and fifteen years, she ventured down her tunneled plight
And was greeted by a troupe of dancing demons stanced to fight
Each demon bid her, ""Say our names, as our names you should know
Until such time your chains will bind us, follow where you go""
And what a joy it is to be the only one who knows
Katrinah Josephina soon identified her foe

Yes, she's still singing the praises of angels and sages
Oh, when the pills wear off, the demons will return
Unless you're brave enough to face the ruler of their world

After years upon the surface higher, learning taught her well
The value of the human soul's a dollar earned in hell
So one year ago upon this night
She dragged me to her hole
Her waist was roped
""Don't dare let go!""
Her voice resounded from below

Keep singing the praises of angels and sages
'Cause when the pills wear off-"

of a wasteland,
believing even the poorest experiences
rich enough for the purposes
and the obscene also illustrious,
yet nothing remarkable was there
then he made way to the pulpit
because his was a heavy soul
in need of cleansing
but the masses heard him not
in fact, some say they weren’t even present
in final desperation
he decided to stop for death
but death was unable to stop for him
since he was fed with the finest
of the wheat and with honey out of the rock
thus spared, he lived on
though whether for a lifetime or a second
he knew not
since all was black….
neurons rushed madly by,
crushing order in their path
and it was then that he knew
all of it as truth.
the key was in telling:
always slant the speech
because the universe is too much."

Summer fade
And on a coast
Not far away
Sometimes we glide
Sometimes we fall
And there are times we dont get up at all
You had your doubts
We had our rows
Said our goodbyes but now were taking vows
Behind the sweet
Summer fade
Youll knock me down like a tidal wave
I should be gone
Cast away
But still id love you
Through all peace and hate
In light of all
Darkest things
The fire glimmers and the darkness sings....
If you should go
I won't have you to blame for my unhappiness for darker days
When will i learn
Its not your fault
Breaking down could not be cured by breaking up
I should be gone
Cast away....
Forever more
Peace and hate
Love and war
Declare a new state....
Yell and shout and kick me out
Then forget what we fought about
But dont give up
These storms are passing"

And I am so much older now

I can't seel him anyhow, a hilltop in the wind

So not to wake a sparrow splashing
But that was many years from now
And I hope from here on out

Ascend into the sun with me""

After all these implements and texts designed by intellects
So vexed to find, evidently there's still so much that hides
And though the saints dub us divine in ancient fading lines
Their sentiment is just as hard to pluck from the vine

I'll try hard not to pretend
Allow myself no mock defense
As I step into the night

Since I don't have the time nor mind to figure out the nursery rhymes
That helped us out in making sense of our lives
The cruel, uneventful state of apathy releases me
I value them but I won't cry every time one's wiped out

I'll try hard not to give in
Batten down to fare the wind
Rid my head of this pretense
Allow myself no mock defense

When she places them in front of you
Nothing holds a Roman candle to
The solemn warmth you feel inside

Nothing else is love

You know I never expected, no I never suspected that
You came to me to steal my love away
You said I've always been a dreamer
'Cos dreaming is all I've ever done
Just like our summer - I thought it would last forever
But as the autumn came, you had gone away
All the promises you broke meant more to me than gold
Now I'm all alone in the heartbreak zone
And the winter will be cold without you
You said I was a born loser
'Cos losing is all I've ever done
Like when I lost you, it proved that all you said was true
And now without you I feel like being used
All the promises you broke meant more to me than gold
And now I'm all alone in the heartbreak zone
And the winter will be cold without you, my Rosalita
All there is left is a photograph
You smile and the ice cream's meltin' down your pants
And I keep living on, you're in the past, it's been so long -
Since the Ice Cream Summer, it's forgotten now it's gone
Now you're just a memory, don't mean nothing more to me
A photo among others of my old friends and my lovers
And the winter is gone, a new summer's coming on
A new summer's coming on for you as well somewhere, Rosalita"

In a black dress.  In a white dress.  We guess at what it means
You write a message you'll mail to me later
I wonder about Joanie
And her alcoholic boyfriend. What do women like that do?  Getting older, didn't live her life like the others.  I wonder for Joanie, but secretly I wonder for me
You said I was elegant as you pressed my shoulders
I thought of the claws of my feet
I tried to hide them, but you found them eventually
If I were air
If I were thoughts that didn't dare
To materialize into flesh
What would I have to kiss you with?"

Caught up inside a dream?
All my life
It`s always been my shadow and me
Over my shoulder
There`s always a voice
Somewhere saying
I never should try to set my heart free
I wish that love would come
And take me in her arms
And show me what I've never known
Where I could hold someone
And words like right and wrong
Just fade away like yesterday

Lonely won't leave me alone
Lonely won't leave me alone
Why?
Tell me why?
Won`t even let me fall in love
Ooh
Everywhere I go
Always by my side
Won't even let me fall in love

I try and say I love you
But the words won't come through
When my eyes see all the tears
And sad memories
Why can't I start out new
And leave that old feeling too?
Far behind
I guess that lonely needs company
Around each bend of road
I`m thinking back in time
There will be that rainbow's end
But when I follow love
Self delusions I find
That it's only lonely and me again

Put another dent in your life?

Written in your head?

Is a story about love

I was young but I wasn't naive
I watched helpless as he turned around to leave
And still I have the pain I have to carry
A past so deep that even you could not bury if you tried

After all this time
I never thought we'd be here
Never thought we'd be here
When my love for you was blind
But I couldn't make you see it
Couldn't make you see it
That I loved you more than you'll ever know
A part of me died when I let you go

I would fall asleep
Only in hopes of dreaming
That everything would be like it was before

They disappear as reality is crashing to the floor

Well only a stranger would think its impossible to let them go
And I have oh so many flashback scenes that I can calmly walk straight through
And now my mind is free to walk the streets we used to walk so quietly
And laid the foundation for this handful of rhymes well I have left the frustration behind my eyes

But I'll stay long after then
And you can have me anytime
Here we are
Alone in the shadows of our lonely rooms
Here we are
We are hollows, very lonely rooms
Like a faithless child
Frightened of the wild he runs and hides
To keep from being still
We run around until we lose ourselves again
On wings of the night
Once again you'll take flight
And I don't hear your voice anymore
Tonight's dream will end
But I'll stay long after then
And you can have me anytime

Languor rises reaching
To turn off the alarm
And there's never so much seething
That it can't be disarmed

You just
Stop it up
Pass it on
Shove it to shelf it
To leave it off and
Turn over

Lounging against your weapons
Until your muscles find lock
In the ease of that position
A residue of tremor passes
As some cherie amour suggests
Maybe it was time to smash things up

But just
Stop it up
Pass it on
Shove it to shelf it
To lead it on and
Turn over

Stop, turnover

Every night the next touch knowing it, knowing it
How did we let it get that far
I don't even know right now who we are
We threw our hearts in a wishing well
Promised we'd never break the spell
I confess, I confess I have been tempted, tempted
I want it, I want it dangerous
Somebody tell me how we got that far
I don't even know right now who we are
And if you know that you're not breathing, get out
We can always just leave here, drive off

Ooh, under the stars we're indestructible

Ooh, under the stars we're indestructible

They were failing dutifully
If you're going to fail at all
Failing came more easily
Than it did to us all

And I wanted to be there
See them again
It was easy to see them
They were the best band to be in

I gave up drugging
When you spiked my drink
Stopped freeloading
When I could not get in

I gave up singing
When I was told I could not dance
Knew my place in the world
When I heard them start

American guitars
American guitars
American guitars
American guitars

Woke up Sunday morning
With a hole the size of my pool
Couldn't believe I'd grown so ugly
Couldn't believe I'd been so cruel

I should've set back
Thought about their past
East coast to west coast
How they'd struggled for their art

Some people were born to write
Some people were born to dance
Thought I knew my place in the world
Thought I knew my art

Glad to be there
See them begin
It was easy to see them
They were the best band to be in

American guitars

They were the real Europeans
In clubs across the land
People held a vigil
They were the best laid French band"

You're everything, that's why I cling to you
When I emerge my thoughts converge to you
To you
The world is so small compared to you
And everybody's wrong compared to you
To you

I begin to see through your eyes
All the former mysteries are no surprise

So now, you listen
'Cause I'm omniscient

Hey, look at me, lady
I'm just a little baby
You're lucky to have me
I'm cute and sweet as candy
As charming as a fable
I'm innocent and disabled
So hug me and kiss me
Then wipe my butt and piss me

I hope you never leave
'Cause who would hear me scream?
Nobody understands
Except the toys in my hands

So now, you listen
'Cause I'm omniscient

Hey, look at me, lady
I'm just a little baby
If I smile, then you smile
Then I'll get mad for a while
I melt in your mouth and
In your hands whenever I can
But I really do nothing
Except kickin' and fussin'

I like to make a mess
I laugh at your distress
I sit all day in my crib
Absorbin' all you give
I'm helpless
I'm flawless
I'm a machine
Give me
I need my toys, wow!

Keep me ever, ever long

I leave it ajar
And go outside
To look at the driveway stars
The crickets are chirping
They stop at my step
I stop my step
And they start up again
It's our anniversary and the bullfrogs
And everything that can sing is singing
Its mating song
The soil is steaming
Grass is swooning
Guns or fireworks are popping
Down in the town
A woman is running
A man jumps up and down
Its our anniversary and you've hidden my keys
This is one anniversary you're spending with me
I slide in the front seat
The driver's side
To hotwire and hightail crosses my mind
But still in the driveway
Fixed like the stars
I flip on the headlights
And go back inside
The climates controlled
While the battery dies
Clipping the wings of your morning flight
The night will end
In some form of excess
Pants around ankles
Too weak to fully undress
Its our anniversary
A celebration of
And here's to next year
Maybe you'll join me in my car
We'll drive together
But not too far
We are far from flowers
Cut and dried
So let us thrive let us thrive
Let us thrive let us thrive
Just like the weeds
We curse sometimes"

If I could have chosen where God would hide his heaven
I would wish for it to be in the salt and swell of the ocean
Carried by the currents to all continents' shores
Reaching into the depths where the sun's light has never shone
Mixed with algae and coral
Breathed in by sharks and dolphins
Sailed by tanker ships, private yachts, swam in by tourists
Working its way up through inlets, lakes, and rivers, swamps, and estuaries
Down through limestone into the aquifer
Purified by the county, pumped through pipes and out faucets
Filled into a glass to meet the thirst of our children

If I could have chosen, I would have been born a woman
My mother once told me she would have named me Laura
I would grow up to be strong and beautiful like her
One day, I'd find an honest man to make my husband
We would have two children, build our home on the Gulf of Mexico
Our family would spend hot summer days at the beach together
The sun would kiss our skin as we played in the sand and water
We would know we loved each other without having to say it
At night, we would sleep with the windows of our house left open
Letting the cool ocean air soothe the sunburned shoulders of our children

There is an ocean in my soul where the waters do not curve
There is an ocean in my soul where the waters do not curve
There is an ocean in my soul where the waters do not curve

I lost myself on a cool, damp night
I gave myself in that misty light
Was hypnotized by a strange delight
Under a lilac tree

I made wine from the lilac tree
Put my heart in its recipe
It makes me see what I want to see
And be what I want to be

When I think more than I want to think
I do things I never should do
I drink much more than I ought to drink
Because it brings me back you

Lilac wine is sweet and heady, like my love
Lilac wine, I feel unsteady, like my love
Listen to me, I cannot see clearly
Isn't that she coming to me? Nearly here

Lilac wine is sweet and heady, where's my love?
Lilac wine, I feel unsteady, where's my love?
Listen to me, why is everything so hazy?
Isn't that she, or am I just going crazy, dear?

Lilac wine, I feel unready for my love

Safe thus far
And Grace will lead us home

Picking fights with myself and my friends
And my friends threatening to do me in

Daybreak
A September sun emerges through clouds
Chasing across the sky
Thoughts are evoked behind detached eyes
But people are just passing by
With smiles for protection
Unable to see behind the creature that he seems to be
Once he was a child with burning desires
With hopes and dreams of what was to come
So he's lost some faith but still there are fires
Deep inside that he must drench to numb
If we could try to share some of his wounds just for a while
But we're all just people passing by
Midday
He's searching through crowds for one that is gone
Rejecting the facts one more day
Talking too loud to silence the glow
Coldness becoming his way
Empathy can't reach through all this blame
Smiles now forgotten, locked in their frames
Now he's counting time in beggings and bottles
Fading away beneath old news
So he lost a war: ""Will I be dead very long?""
He can still hear his voice through the coldness
If we could try to ease some of his pain just for a while
But we're all just people passing by



Once he was strong and filled with visions
With life ahead he set his aims
Then things went wrong
Now his ambitions have turned to smiles conserved in frames
Still could be strong, could be a prophet
He would teach truth to every man
He'd see the light through every shadow
But Entropia denies he can
He's sitting numb while dusk is falling
Alone he whispers his ""Goodnight""
Turning away, when sleep is calling
From all the people passing by"

Kissed your neck

Once again in my path, once again I am faced
With the cold truth of Autumn, the tease of her taste

Oh won't you hold it against me

What to say to make your heartbeat stop

Of New England and into the deep south
Just to pull back clouds that hide the sun
Just to burst through your windows just for fun
Could you feel when I snuck in?
Starting slowly a battle I could never win
Could you feel when I burst through
I am the sunlight drenching you

It draws death dancing out of little countries
With funny languages
Where the ground is getting harder and it was
Not that soft before
But those who call the shots
Are never in the line of fire
Why
When there's life for hire out there
If the flag of truth were raised
We could watch every liar rise to wave it
Here we learn america like a script
Playright, birthright - same thing
We bring ourselves to the role
We're all rehearsing for the presidency
I always wanted to be commander in chief
Of my one woman army
But i can envision the mediocrity of my finest hour
It's the failed america in me
It's the fear that lives
In a forest of stone, underneath the corporate canopy
Where the sun rarely filters down
And the ground
Is not so soft......"

Made into a word complete

My receiving eyes exchanged with fuses
Blindness induced to prevent destruction
Ceramic blades implanted past my ribs

I tear my worthless, useless skin
Staples to pin it over my ears
Non-receptive of ungodly sounds
I disable the audio-generators of fear
Hexagonal bolts to fill my mouth
Sharpened to deplete
The creator of all violence
Without speech there will be no deceit
Baptized in vitriolic acid
A final touch, a smoothing of features
Completion of the greatest art
To cast the godly creatures
Humans, once astray, made divine
Stripped of congenital flaws
We're incandescent revelations in a world of darkened forms

To save a failed humanity
Follow the god of cyanide into the new eternity
Behold, a sacrificial race
In cleansing worshipping of pain

Draining their fluid through beakers and pots

Terrified corpses unable to moan now

Stroking the liver kidneys and heart

Tortured with Bon Jovi and David Bowie LPs

It could still happen

How do I master the perfect day?

Seven phone calls

Anyway

Just lean into the crack (Just lean into the crack)
And it will tremble ever so nicely
Notice how it sparkles down there

But it's not up to me
What I get given
Unthinkable surprises about to happen
But what they are

Deep down here in the dry and the heat

Threatened not to breathe a word to a living soul
Especially mother

It wasn't the way it's supposed to go
He needed a father, not this hunter

To speak of the unspeakable
Takes guts and nerve
It's going to disturb
He can't bring himself to say the words
Misplaced blind faith in church and state
Tied up in too much red tape
But if help comes, pray not too late
We face ourselves, look long and hard
Make the difference, a safer place

Where people saying: ""My God, that's tough""
""She stood him up""
""No point in us remaining""
""We may as well go home""
As I did on my own
Alone again, naturally
To think that only yesterday
I was cheerful, bright and gay
Looking forward to, who wouldn't do?
The role I was about to play?
But as if to knock me down
Reality came around
And without so much as a mere touch
Cut me into little pieces
Leaving me to doubt
Talk about God in His mercy
Who, if He really does exist
Why did He desert me?
In my hour of need
I truly am indeed
Alone again, naturally
It seems to me that there are more hearts
Broken in the world that can't be mended
Left unattended
What do we do? What do we do?
Alone again, naturally
Looking back over the years
And whatever else that appears
I remember I cried when my father died
Never wishing to hide the tears
And at sixty-five years old
My mother, God rest her soul
Couldn't understand why the only man
She had ever loved had been taken
Leaving her to start with a heart so badly broken
Despite encouragement from me
No words were ever spoken
And when she passed away
I cried and cried all day
Alone again, naturally
Alone again, naturally"

The summer left her without forgiveness
It's mirrored in her children's eyes

Carry mandas that they might
Be delivered from the depths of darkness
And born again by candlelight
And born again by candlelight

Blisters on my feet, wooden rosary
I felt them in my pocket as I ran
A bullet in the night, a Federales' light
San Francisco, do you understand?
Tell him that I made the journey
And tell him that my heart is true
I'd like his blessing of forgiveness
Before the angels send it through

And I will know that I am clean now
And I will dance and the band will play
In the old Artu cantina
Cups will runneth over the ancient clay
And if I should fall to temptation
When I return to evil throes
From Nogales to Magdalena
As a two time beggar I will go
Where I know I can be forgiven

Now exploded across the globe in minutes
And built upon itself in waves whose thunderous crash echoed back to their inventor

You didn't know me when you were a kid
In trouble at school, alone at lunch again
I didn't know you when I broke my knee
Spent the summer on crutches and everybody teased
Except for this one friend I almost forgot

You didn't know me, but he knew me best
The weight of my brain and the fear of my cold head
You never saw me, interred in the ice
My friend tried to melt, but he couldn't thaw me out right
So I got ditched freezing, alone with my thoughts

And though I once said I was better off just being dead
Better off just being dead, without my old friend
True, I once said, I was better off just being dead
But I didn't know you yet

You didn't know me, but you got cold, too
And your mind was heavy, and you thought you might lose it
Well everything fucked up we both felt before
I'm glad for it all if it got us where we are
With you in the boat there, I almost forgot

How I once said I was better off just being dead
Better off just being dead, I didn't know you yet

And I drove with your hand on my lap
When San Diego got too unkind
We just picked up and left him behind
And we had some love and some hope

Deep in a sleeping bag in your back yard
When we woke up buried alive
Beneath the fruity landslide
We both laughed hysterically

Hope is a citrus constellation in the galaxy
Scratched on the back of both my eyelids
That I've been dying to see (dying to see)

And we'd sing along with the crowds

Change your name a million times

In a new rhythm I breathe

On the wings of every kiss
Drifts a melody so strange and sweet

My heart's a lighter thing
Since you made this night a thing divine

Be loving sentimental me

Will you wait for me there until someone comes

With their arms so thin and their skin so old
But you are young, you are young, you are young

Then somebody laughs like it's all just for hell
As though we could not be saved from the depths of the well
But the cloth that I make is a cloth you can sell
To pay for the gossamer seed

Of the ones who stay and the ones who leave
I will wait for you there with these cindered bones

euphoric;Positive/Uplifting;Positive Emotions;Positive Sentiments;"Beneath the arc of the rounded rainbow ley
Whistled the lark as the arrow lost its way
The Blue lightless perfect-colored obfuscaire
Still supine, I crossed the sandy veil
Falling forever through each measure
All moral minds sentinel
Falling to Hell
Breathe together
Farewell
The circle we drew as we moved but tried to look down was wiped away with the sound of the morning rooster's crow...
His tail was tied to a hammer and he dragged it to the horizon
In the hallway outside my bedroom door
I heard the old dead sleigh gliding to its restful drones, purposely knocking the pictures off their nails
With a vacancy ogling my sober inhalation, our curator's rocking to the rhythm of the rain on her carved hair here in this room, with the inverted torches at its barrier, where materia vibrated out
Its vibration left a plume climbing its way up a blue-blessed curl, which was girdled by aurora of obliging black morel
Then, I called and cried out while I minded the bell that dangled crazily closet edge of the basin of the rain which fell
(It fell in the shape of a bifurcated ammonite shell)
A beacon as blue as a bowerbird's eye in the morn
A poem written in threes over four
My oeuvre based on the coy and forlorn
Another boy's parallel night in the harrow
And the quiet decline of my questionable rhythm
Disinterested forever in upwards motion
I hung out by the white chalk letters
I watched my body move and let it"

Remember those times I could call
Through the clear daytime and you'd be there
Braver and braver, a handkerchief waver
The louder your lips to a loud hailer
Growing together, the good of each other
On a wondering, stumbling, fumbling, rumbling
Minds shot together, our minds shot together
So equally over a valley, a hill
Wood on quarry stood
Each of us crying
Velvet curtain of grey
Mark the blanket where the sparrows play
And the trees by the waving corn stranded

Mote to a grog, star of white chalk

Yesterday's gone but today remembers
Doesn't it seem to come down the same for everyone?

Everything else illusion (Only love)

The way we connive at being alive
Tracing a line 'til we can define
The thing that allows us to feel
Only love is real

Childhood dreams like muddy waters
Flowing through me to my son and daughters
Everything I ever thought is confirmed as truth to me
Even as I see the way that I want to go now
Still I wish I had known what I know now
Maybe I could have spared you
Giving your youth to me

There used to be a time when I thought I had the answers
Answers to the questions that nobody knew
Used to be a time when I had some time
But when I had the time I didn't know what to do
Wasted all those years never gettin' any younger
Times kept a-changin but I still got the hunger
Only trouble is the walls are closin in
Sometimes I wanna give it all away

I just wanna be free
Free like the wind
And if the wind fills my sails
Then I'm never coming back again

Maybe I'll head down south to New Orleans
Wouldn't have no taxes 'cause I wouldn't have the means
Looking for a genie that could fill my dreams
But dreams become reality and real ain't what it seems to be

I just wanna be free
Free like the wind
And if the wind fills my sails
Then I'm never coming back again

I just wanna be free
Free like the wind
And if the wind fills my sails

His houses were built upon the sand

Well the people feasted and drank their wine
And praised the false gods of his time

In blood the hand began to write
And Belshazzar couldn't hide his fright

What was written by the mystic hand

Satan is real again

Instead of fighting bad thoughts
I have made friends with these

We giggle helplessly

Don't like the Devil's jokes
They do not comprehend irony
They are worse than their folks
Satan has told me privately
That I must stop this trend
To punish non-free thinkers
Satan has come again

Sometimes, I get excited
By thoughts which he gives me
He shows me rape and murder
We chuckle merrily, merrily
We have long conversations
About child A and B
""Child B,"" I say ""was with me""
""Child A is just like me,"" says he

I freed myself from morals and from the social fog
If you think you need these things, my friend, you are caught
They tie your ring to posts, they trap your wings in honey
The social, moral world is not very funny

Find humor through amorals
And you will happy be
Laugh loud at human suffering

To be beat back by dark clouds
And a harsh reeking wind
And that battle staggered
Through three awful months there
To stop for a minute
Just to start up again
Your hands like birds in the trees
If the trees themselves were all on fire
Your hips on mine make a choir
Singing, ""Baruch atta adonai""
And the river never made it to the lake
So the lake surrendered to the mountains
And the mountain's heart did fucking break
At the sight of your nervous hands
And oh, my love, so gently breathing
So my heart does softly swell
So her and me did greet the evening
With much red wine and giddy yells
In these times of wandering soldiers
Building towers on ruined land
I hold my love to my belly
And her feel breath fall across my hands
I have grown tired of the struggle
And I've grown tired of making plans
I think I'll quit to the valley
Regain my strength and start again
Where once we were some clumsy army
And now we are just lazy hens
I think I'll quit to the valley
Until the light moves me again
So let's link arms, sisters and brothers
And let's promise not to retreat
Well, there is glory in our failure
So let's march to the rhythm of fatigue
To live our lives without leaders
To live in joy without fear
Let's walk together to the valley
And let the lights redeem our tears"

I was underage in this funky bar
And I stepped outside to smoke

And I turned my amp up loud and I
Began to play

And those towns that shut down so early
I think of your body, right where it should be
And I think, I should get rid of it
That old brown chair clicked, and rang loud as hell
And he said you were a drunk, it rang loud as hell
And your brother said ""bullshit""
And I never told anyone, but it kept me awake
Spring sleep's never been good to me anyway
And I got your picture sitting on the sink
You were so young, so skinny, so quick to laugh
And water dripped and hit your cheek in the right spot
It ruined my week, when I just wanted to wash the filth off
And I have this feeling where I’m still owed something
And every April I'm reminded about those bright flowers they talk about
And every May I'm reminded that it's better buried in black and white
And I'll allow myself this tonight

And even Lord Byron was leaving for Greece
While back at the Hilton, last but not least

Or we'll never get out of East Texas tonight
That the trail is long and the river is wide
And my ride's here""

Of everything I am and of some things I am not

It's the reason they made it all easier
You'll never know the hit

And you were naked, which was weird

In oceans of oh I see, I see

Of absolutely no regrets
And later maybe you could try
To let your losses dangle off

And talk about the weather, or
How the weather used to be

And I'll cater with all the birds that I can kill
Let their tiny feathers fill disappointment
Lie down lick the sorrow from your skin
Scratch the terror and begin
To believe you're strong

And frankly that thing doesn't really interest me

And it's magic if the music is groovy

There was a lullaby I treasure the most

I can still hear Mommy say no

Stay away from that door

A sensory lullaby
We trade the comic cartoons and magazines
For pistons and gasoline
We see the road from the bedside
Parked under the sunshine
We feel the warmth of the engine
So we climb inside
And take to the motorway
Watch the clouds turn into faces, it's fun to play
Shift the gears for years and age a single day
Until we spill onto Russian Hill
Past cathedrals filled with God's favorite guests
Dirty hands feel clean
Dressed in their Sunday best
Treeline village oh so heavenly
Cross a bridge of gold to landscapes of juniper
Only Eden is for millionaires
Watch the clouds turn into faces its fun to play
Shift the gears for years and age a single day
Until we spill onto Russian Hill
I'm pulling through the last stoplight
We head home past the shoreline
And through the rear view mirror it melts away
Till we're helpless
Watch the clouds turn into faces, Its fun to play

We shift the gears for years and age a single day

For like curtains close this sunset matinee

When it all breaks down and we're runaways
Standin' in the wake of our pain
And we stare straight into nothin'
But we call it all the same
You were raised on a promise

Or watch as it all breaks down here

Well, the break down here
Stole it all the way across
I wanna climb downhill
Stranded on
When you come here and I'm wasted
Lyin' on a field, dancin' in the rain
Hidin' in the back, loosenin' my grip
Wadin' in the water, just tryin' not to crack

Take me to a place where i can see
Where there's no darkness to surround me

This love i feel inside will last tillthis world crumbles
And i will love you from now on
I will love the way you look at me
The way you look into my eyes,and show me

Across these waters that has come between us
My heart beats fast
And my knees are getting weaker
Every thought i have is of you
Give me just one more thought of you"

Though you’re only seventeen
Far too much of life you’ve seen
Syncopated child
Maybe if you only knew
Where your path is leading to
You’d become less wild
But I know it’s vain
Trying to explain
While there’s this insane
Music in your brain
Dance, dance, dance little lady
Youth is fleeting to the rhythm
Beating in your mind
Dance, dance, dance little lady
So obsessed with second best
No rest you’ll ever find
Time and tide and trouble
Never, never wait
Let the cauldron bubble
Justify your fate
Dance, dance, dance little lady
Dance, dance, dance little lady
Leave tomorrow behind
When the saxaphone
Gives a wicked moan
Charleston, hey, hey
Rhythms fall and rise
Start dancing to the tune
The bands crooning—
For soon the night will be gone
Start swaying like a reed
Without heeding
The speed
That hurries you on
Syncopate your nerves
Till your body curves
Drooping, stooping
Laughter some day dies
And when the lights are starting to gutter
Dawn—through the shutter—
Shows you're living in a world of lies
Dance, dance, dance little lady
Youth is fleeting to the rhythm
Beating in your mind
Dance, dance, dance little lady
So obsessed with second best
No rest you’ll ever find

Were you made ashamed, why'd you lock them in a drawer?

Than when you turned away, when you slammed the door
When you stole a car and drove towards Mexico
And you wrote bad checks just to fill your arm
I was young enough, I still believed in war

Well, let the poets cry themselves to sleep
And all their tearful words would turn back into steam

But me, I'm a single cell, on a serpent's tongue
There's a muddy field where a garden was
And I'm glad you got away, but I'm still stuck out here
My clothes are soaking wet from your brother's tears

And I never thought this life was possible

Love rising from the mists
Promise me this and only this
Holy breath touching me like a wind song
Sweet communion of a kiss

Sun sifting through the gray
Enter in, reach me with a ray
Silently swooping down, just to show me
How to give my heart away

Once a crystal choir appeared
While I was sleeping and called my name
And when they came down nearer, saying, ""Dying is done,""
Then a new song was sung until somewhere we breathed as one

And still I hear their whisper

Stars bursting in the sky
Hear the sad nova's dying cry
Shimmering memory, come and hold me
While you show me how to fly

Sun sifting through the gray
Enter in, reach me with a ray
Silently swooping down, just to show me
How to give my heart away

Lately sparkling hosts come fill my dreams
Descending on fiery beams
I've seen 'em come clear down where our poor bodies lay
Soothe us gently and say, ""Gonna wipe all your tears away""

And still I hear their whisper

Love, rising from the mists
Promise me this and only this
Holy breath touching me like a wind song

Pa drove to town yesterday to pick out her grave
He found the lot where she'd lay
Then he drove to old man Ed Sutterton's place
To find him some peace

He got there 'round about twelve
And he stayed till three
And the sun left him down in the valley
But the moon met him up in the hills by the lake
Reflecting the ghost of ma's place

Suppertime came and it went
No one heard from him
Sis left his food on his plate
At the end of the table right next to ma's place
Where nobody sits

The telephone rang 'bout four
My sis answered it
And I felt the news through the floor boards
Like a long, sullen moan
Like a wreck on the road
Like a joining of hands

Sha la la la, sha la la la, sha la la la

Paddy And The Whale
PADDY AND THE WHALE
Paddy O'Brian left Ireland in glee
He had a strong notion old England to see
He shipped in the Nellie, for England was bound
And the whiskey he drank made his head go around
Cho: Laddy whack, fol de dol, fol de rol I dee dee *
O, Paddy been never sailing before
It made his heart ache when he heard the loud roar
For the glance of his eye, a whale he did spy:
""I'm going to be ate,"" says Paddy,""by-and-by""
O, Paddy run forward and caught hold of the mast
He grasped his arms round and there he held fast
The boat gave a tip, and, losing his grip
Down in the whale's belly poor Paddy did slip
He was down in the whale six months and five days
Till luck one day to his throat he did pop
The whale give a snort and then give a blow
And out on the land poor Paddy did go
O, Paddy is landed and safe on the shore
He swears that he 'll never go to sea any more
The next time he wishes old England to see
It will be when the railroad runs over the sea

Pull your shirt down, save me, save me

Press my thumb onto your tongue
Hand a knife up to me
No mouth, no neck, no rest

And I’m ashamed that I don’t have a heart you can break
I’m just action
And other times reaction

And so I finished up my prayer, rose slowly and I stared
But I was empty as a grave and ghostless was the air

Again begged the thunderbolt to strike to mark me or else I would die

Where are you my long lost love
It feels like yesterday us parting
I held you closest to my thrusting heart
Now the withdrawal seems to be starting

You’re not like anyone I've known
With you I flourish into greatness
Extend my arms into immense delight
Making my future vast and weightless

Quite an undertaking
All fair promises
I stopped hearing you grow
Quite an understatement
And harm surfaces that is hidden in snow

I should have kept you safe
Shielded from our trojan war

Where are you my partisan
The last I saw of you was sinking
Into a giant hole of nothingness
As my desire started shrinking

Or if I choose to take you back
(If you can swallow all that pride)
If I stand up for my believing
(If you can still be what I lack)
Can we make up for all the joy we lack
(Where is the passion you were bringing?)
Can we start giving and receiving
(What is the purpose of me giving?)


Quite an undertaking
All fair promises
I stopped hearing you grow
Quite an understatement
And harm surfaces that is hidden in snow

Left this haunted town
The spookiness of night surrounds us in trees
Us on bikes on fountains
Never been alone as such
Your foots on the clutch
Your hands on my crotch
Slow down
And run in little circles 'til circles are
Black and on the ground
And clever isn't where it's at
'cause dumb is back
Heads are holes and clouds

And I've never seen you frown this much
It's time that we got this flaunting down
A feather in a baseball cap
You dance all whack
Weakened knees call
And I've never seen you frown this much
It's time that we rocked three daunting nouns
It's better not to hollaback
'cause life long cracks
Speak through these walls"

To tell you to stay home. You’re going to fuck things up

Twiddle your thumbs and act like now’s not the time to be dumb

Now, hobbits are peace-loving folks, you know
They're never in a hurry and they take things slow
They don't like to travel away from home
They just like to eat and be left alone!

But one day Bilbo was asked to go
On a big adventure to the caves below
To help some dwarves get back their gold
That was stolen by a dragon in the days of old

He's only three feet tall

Well he fought with the goblins!
He battled a troll!
He riddled with Gollum!
A magic ring he stole!
He was chased by wolves!
Lost in the forest!
Escaped in a barrel from the elf-king's halls!

Sometimes in the morning
I am petrified and can't move
Awake, but cannot open my eyes
And the weight is crushing down
On my lungs, I know I can't breathe
And hope someone will save me this time
And your mother's still calling you insane and high
Swearing it's different this time
And you tell her to give in
To the demons that possess her
And that God never blessed her insides
Then you hang up the phone
And feel badly for upsetting things
Crawl back into bed to dream of a time
When your heart was open wide
And you loved things just because
Like the sick and the dying

And sometimes when you're on
You're really fucking on
And your friends, they sing along and they love you
But the lows are so extreme
That the good seems fucking cheap
And it teases you for weeks in its absence
But you'll fight and you'll make it through
You'll fake it if you have to
And you'll show up for work with a smile
And you'll be better and you'll be smarter
And more grown up and a better daughter
Or son, and a real good friend
And you'll be awake, you'll be alert
You'll be positive though it hurts
And you'll laugh and embrace all your friends
You'll be a real good listener
You'll be honest, you'll be brave
You'll be handsome and you'll be beautiful
You'll be happy

Your ship may be coming in
You're weak, but not giving in
To the cries and the wails of the valley below
And your ship may be coming in
You're weak, but not giving in
And you'll fight it, you'll go out fighting all of them"

I'm sitting on the Cafe Zinho steps
With a book I haven't started yet
Watching all the girls walk by
Could I take you out
I'd be yours without a doubt
On that big dipper
And if the sound of this it frightens you
We could play it real cool
And act somewhat indifferent
And hey June
Why'd you have to come
Why'd you have to come around so soon
I wasn't ready for all this nature
The terrible green, green grass
The violent blooms of flower dresses
And afternoons that make me sleepy
But we could wait awhile
Before we push that dull turnstile
Into the passage
The thousands they have tread
And others sometimes fled
Before the turn came
And we could wait our lives
Before a chance arrives
Before the passage
From the top you can see Monterey
Or think about San Jose
Although I know it's not that pleasant
And hey Jim Kerouac
Brother of the famous Jack
Or so he likes to say, lucky bastard
He's sitting on the Cafe Zinho steps
With a girl that I'm not over yet
Watching all the world go by
Boy you're looking bad
Did I make you feel that sad?
I'm honestly flattered
But if she asks me out
I'd be hers without a doubt
On that big dipper

And get yourself a new tattoo

You used to leave it occasionally, but now you don't even bother
To ride that commuter train west to Chicago
To stroll through the greenery in the park past the statues

How their eyes seemed to follow you like a hated addiction
Their beauty carved out of absolutes that you could never claim
Or even envision

Yeah, I thought you were beautiful but I wept with your movements
But I hope that you're laughing now from that place on the carpet

But she asked me to care for you, yes she did
And I went and betrayed her

And we're quick to surrender

Whipping past the reflecting pool
Me and you skipping school
And we make it up as we go along

You said you raced from Langley
Pulling me underneath a cherry blossom canopy
Do I have? Of course I have beneath my raincoat
I have your photographs

And the sun on your face
I'm freezing that frame

And somewhere Alfie cries
And says, ""Enjoy his every smile
You can see in the dark
Through the eyes of Laura Mars""
""How did it go so fast?""
You'll say as we are looking back
And then we'll understand
We held gold dust in our hands

Letting names hang in the air
What colour hair?
Autumn knowingly stared
Auburn crimson

And the day that she came

Think how happy we can be when we just try

While we're at it, we have a sort of a cowboy song we'd like to do for ya. This is a song that deals with the rapidly approaching 200th birthday of the United States of America, ladies and gentlemen! This is a song that warns you in advance that next year everybody is gonna try and sell you things that maybe you shouldn't ought to buy, and not only that, they've been planning it for years. The name of this song is (pardon me), ""Poofters Froth Wyoming Plans Ahead""

March Eleven Sixty-Seven
Take a letter, Ms. Abetter
An' our pigeons will be homing
To our jobbers in Dakota
And to Merwyn, Minnesota
This is merely just a note about
Performance to our quota
Well, we've all come out to show them
An' the Elks have helped us load 'em
Little packets full of jackets
Little rackets, little rackets

Little Poofter-Cloth Appointments
Little Poofter's Froth Anointments
Little hoods, little goods
Little doo-dads from the woods
The entire stock is shipping
Oh, our shod is hardly slipping!
To our markets of the world
Our wrinkled pennants are unfurled!
T-shirt racks, rubber snacks
Poster rolls with matching tacks
Yes, a special beer for sports
And paper cups that hold two quarts!

Everything a nation needs
For making hoopla while it feeds
The trash compactors, small reactors
Mowers, blowers, throwers and the glowers
This is Buy-Cent-Any-All Salute
Two hundred years have gone ka-poot!
Ah but we have been astute!

Because I can tell what's going on

I'm working out most every day and watching what I eat
They tell me that it's good for me, but I don't even care
I know that it's crazy

But there is no denying that
It's hip to be square

And those that were the farthest out have gone the other way
You see them on the freeway, it don't look like a lot of fun
But don't you try to fight it, an idea whose time has come
Don't tell me that I'm crazy
Don't tell me I'm nowhere
Take it from me

Around
All is faith
Unwound
I found a lead
A single furtive reason
My senses reeled
In seeking youthful madness
I trust belief belongs to me
Someone will come
To spit the seed
A single weed gets respect
I'll change my quills to break the will
Forever must hold
All things strain
Be they changed
Be they fair
Be they hope
Masked as care
All things change
Never rest, never sure

Be there

And so we fall into the vein

The fear of anchoring into love
Could be the first time, it could be anywhere
I should be able if my will is there

Jokester, a trickster and a romancer

Nowadays it's all black and white like the keys of a piano
The world needs more color and love, but what do I know?
Driving around the snow as I watch out for potholes
I hear God talking but it’s overshadowed by el Diablo
Things that you don't know
Best to keep it so
A massive shadow cast over our futures present past
To face the ultimate horror
Pathetic beauty exposed by longing
A song for nothing as our secret ode to destruction (Blinding)
Enshrinеd by grace in a world so strange
(No one fucking carеs)

Silence ringing hatred, putrid fucking evil

Saw there you shining
Breathe, blinding us
Would they still hide you?
Fine after all, still full of love, undying (Best to keep it so)
True world's so frightening
Once I was too much, I just tried to collapse
Like a child in the garden, lay on my back on the grass
Dreaming about a portal to another world and laugh
Reality escape, it’s just another game
Dirty drugs since thirteen, I think it's just the fame
The modern fame, dream about being invincible and walk the streets again

Don't read between the lines

I was born down by the river
Where the dirty water flows
And the cold wind cut through me
It cut right through my clothes
And the anger and the yearning
Like fever in my veins
Set the fire burning

She came down from Knightstown
With her hands hard from the line
From the first time I laid eyes on her
I knew that she'd be mine
Her father was a lawman
He swore he'd shoot me dead
'Cause he knew I wanted Jeannie
And I'd have her like I said

Jeannie needs a shooter
Shooter like me
Jeannie needs a shooter
Jeannie needs a shooter
Shooter on her side
Jeannie needs a shooter

Jeannie needs a shooter
Jeannie needs a shooter


We met down by the river
On the final day in May
And when I leaned down to kiss her
She did not turn away
I drew out all my money
And together we did vow
To leave that very evening
And get away somehow

Jeannie needs a shooter
Shooter like me
Jeannie needs a shooter
Jeannie needs a shooter
Shooter on her side
Jeannie needs a shooter

Jeannie needs a shooter

The night was cold and rainy
Down by the borderline
I was riding hard to meet her
When a shot rang out behind
As I lay there in the darkness
With a pistol by my side
Jeannie and her father rode off into the night

With their pets, just talking shit
About how we're all so upset
About the disappearing ground

And how eventually our hands will just turn to dust
If we keep shaking them
Standing here on this frozen lake

But I won't go to the doctor to find out about it
'Cause they make you stay real still in a real small space
As they chart up your insides and put them on display
They'd see all of it, all of me, all of it

All of the good that won't come out of me
And all the stupid lies I hide behind
It's such a big mistake
Lying here in your warm embrace

Oh, you're almost home
I've been waiting for you to come in
Dancing around in your old suits
Going crazy in your room again
I think I'll go out and embarrass myself
By getting drunk and falling down in the street
You say I choose sadness
That it never once has chosen me
Maybe you're right

Let's talk about all our friends who lost the war
And all of the novels that had yet to be written about them

And all the stupid lies they hide behind

Will you wake up by my side?”

This addict is mellowing
I can't pretend that I'm tough
Just a little is enough
{Instrumental}

Just like a sailor heading into the seas
There's a gale blowing in my face
The high winds scare me but I need the breeze
And I can't head for any other place

Life would seem so easy on the other tack
But even a hurricane won't turn me back
You might be an island
On the distant horizon
But the little I see
Looks like heaven to me
I don't care if the ocean gets rough
Just a little is enough

Put you in a tiny box that's filled with old victims who
Can't explain how they love their moms
And all the hands that retreat
They try to slip right down their pussy
But there's nothing that you thought is wrong

But you are too beautiful to fuck
You're too beautiful

Slice my eyes
Took me through another night that goes all night through
That tries to seize what their hearts have lost
My best friend took me in
And laid me down beside my own sin
And I said ""Can you please forgive the love?""

'Cause you are too beautiful to fuck

Make the nights seem brighter than they are

In a hopeless porn parade

You slaughtered your loving man
Killed him in his sleep
And the blood and crying of your murder
Simply stains your sheets

You're a ghost on the highway
Your gesture is meaningless
You're lost to the living men
Trailing souls to the end

You thought winning as a woman meant failing as a friend
It is not an art statement to drown a few passionate men
You made yourself a diamond
To blind young men's eyes
You claim because they want your shine
They deserve to walk the line

Your gesture is meaningless
You're lost forever to the living men
Trailing souls to the end, oh

So my soul would not starve
But, it could never move the honest rock
Of what you really are

A ghost on the highway
You're like straw and meaningless
And I hate you, but I love you
And I'll carry that to the end

If I ever lie with you again, I pray I do not sleep
And If I ever closed my eyes again, I'd realize what you are to me
You are simply a liar
An animal who bluffs and steals
Until you become
A bigger creature's meal

Hanging on the hall wall
We watch them 'cross the desert
From an armchair in the hall
We saw the world from the edge of our seat
Dance with the harem and drank with sheet
The man on the back of the camels were following me
And we make ourselves a home
At the foot of the steps
Blankets and old wooden chairs
And we stayed there
We laid there, room go smaller
We beg for water but went for air
So we ran away from our old brittle home
We thought it was sand
And the lamp was the sun
So let's get outside
Â€~Cause we've been inside for too long
And we take a drive
And the buildings all turn into trees
And after a while
We find ourselves down by the sea
The beach was a dessert
Outside in an old magazine
The sheiks and the harem
Were under the waves
The camels they all wash away
And no one is happier
And nothing is free
So I think to myself
We should go and get us a drink"

Take my hand
And walk in the light
Understand, there's a fire to ignite

You know we have a responsibility
It's true we've been chosen
And now we have the possibility
Of melting what's frozen


Walk with me with the rapture inside
Can't you see it's not our place to decide

You know we have to make a case for love
It's more of a duty
It's clear we have a mission from above
A mission of beauty

You know I wouldn't lie to you
What would I achieve by that
It's more than I would try to do
These are the facts

Take your place here
With love in your heart
Just embrace what you've known from the start

We are fulfilling our only destiny
The angels have spoken
And all the gods in the universe agree
The spell can't be broken"

I was driving in my car
Late at night, all alone
Then he stopped me, asked me for a ride
There you were on your own

Now ask me why do I feel my heart's on fire
Ask me, why do I feel this strange desire
Ask me, why do I feel like I'm falling
Falling?

Take me home
What a wonderful way to go
Take me home
What a wonderful way to go

Licking your greasy spoon, jukebox playing my tune
Making out in your room, blowing up your balloon
Playing you like a bassoon, but if I only knew
Where we were driving to, I wouldn't have let you fill my tank
I pulled in, to your truck stop and I'm
Sleeping on the asphalt
Eighteen, wheelin' and siphon gas
And I'm feeling you're my big 10-4

Now ask me why do I feel my heart's on fire
Ask me, why do I feel this strange desire
Ask me, why do I feel like I'm falling
Falling?

Now if you're looking for a lady to snuggle up in your bed
You'd better think about movies or pictures instead
For you don't make love in Panama
Until you've bought a camera
Standing up and down the sidewalks with duty frees in their hands
Showing off with a price tag to make you understand
That you don't make love in Panama
Until you've bought a camera
Any kind of little something that you wanna try
All depends on what you buy
For if you buy a watch, that will only keep her smiling
Bring out the old 'greenbacks', show us to your room
Let's make some movies, looking through the zoom into
Love, sweet love in Panama
Let us buy your camera
So if you go to Panama, look down the old street
Pick out the best camera and you'll get a real treat
For you don't make love in Panama

I won't wait to hear them say
""You were wrong all along.""
We've been drowning, and we've been doubting
I think it's time for a change...

Gonna do all I can
To stay away from the quicksand
Gonna do all I can

Instead of dropping the ball, I seem to carry so many

Turned around

So, I went on down to the park

Thought I heard something behind the bushes
But I was alone!
So, I walked down the middle of the road
The car! The car is coming!
It was gone!
Again, I was alone
So, I walked up the street
Down an alley
Slipped on some mud
I was alone and messy too
Down the sidewalk, past my block
All the lights were out, and I was alone
Walked into my apartment
I was alone
So, I put in my undies
And I was alone
Slipped into my bed, alone
Went to sleep
And I started to dream
I was at this big ball, there were millions of people
And they were all there and so was I!
There was so many people, all of them my friends!
Everyone... everyone talking, laughing, joking with me!
Oh, I was so... So happy. Oh, I was so happy!

Word is she had unfinished business
So back on earth she had to flee

And when she didn't answer

How precious life can be (Ooh-ooh, yeah)
Just hold on and I'm sure you'll understand it

A city freeze, get on your knees
Pray for warmth and green paper
A city drought, you're down and out
See your trousers don't taper
Saddle up, kick your feet
Ride the range of a London street
Travel to a local plane
Turn around and come back again

And at the chime of a city clock
Put up your roadblock
Hang on to your crown
For a stone in a tin can
Is wealth to the city man
Who leaves his armour down

Stay indoors, beneath the floors
Talk with neighbours only
The games you play make people say
You're either weird or lonely
A city star won't shine too far
On account of the way you are
And the beads around your face
Make you sure to fit back in place

And at the beat of a city drum
See how your friends come
In twos, or threes, or more
For the sound of a busy place
Is fine for a pretty face
Who knows what a face is for

The city clown will soon fall down
Without a face to hide in
And he will lose if he won't choose
The one he may confide in
Sonny boy with smokes for sale
Went to ground with a face so pale
And never heard about the change
Showed his hand and fell out of range

In the light of a city square
Find out the face that's fair
Keep it by your side
When the light of the city falls
You fly to the city walls
Take off with your bride
But at the chime of a city clock
Put up your roadblock
Hang on to your crown

There is no way I'm looking for a scene
I need to save some dough
I'm a working girl, you know
I'll fend attention off, I keep to myself

I love my room, I'm getting used to sleeping
Some nights I really like to lie awake
I hear the midnight birds
The message in their words
The dawn will touch me in a way a boy could never touch
Their promise never meant so much to me

You have been warned, I'm born to be contrary
Backward at school, I wrote from right to left
Teacher never cared for me
Preacher said a prayer for me
God help the girl
She needs all the help she can get

I sit for hours just waiting for his phone call
I'll eat the chocolate hidden in the fridge
I'll play his messages
Analyze his intonation
Please stop me there, I'm even boring myself

I think of him when I'm doing the dishes
I think of him while looking in the sink
This ain't no play on words
My love for him's absurd
If he gave me a sign, I'd think about it for a week
I'd build it up and then I'd turn him down

I come from nowhere
And you should go there
Just try it for a while
The people from nowhere
Always smile
Their eyes are all frozen over
The sides of their faces pooch out at the corners
Because that's what happens when their mouths turn up
On both sides
Which is why we can tell they're smiling
They never frown
They never let their eyebrows turn down
They like going around with their teeth showing
All the time
They are from nowhere
Your teeth are showing
So maybe you been there
You could have the disease of nowhere people
Where the air gets stuck all over their gums
When their nowhere lips roll back
For real excitement
They stand still
They shut up
Then they don't do nothing

Love like ours should never die with years
Once you start, you can't ever go backwards

These people want to change things
They're dangerous to know

Take you clean away from me
There's not much that I own
But I'd like to think that I own you
Have I ever told you
I only see my face
When I look into your eyes?
Well how can I forgive your open legs
Which stopped me dead in my tracks
Like a flytrap traps a passing fly
And have you ever noticed
How we never ever swallow anybody's lies?
God, that makes me strong
And now we've cleared the air
Let's stay to watch the penalties dispatch
Punching women kicking men
Five on one, one on ten
These fuckers getting all that they deserve
It's just tricks with mirrors
That makes them think they're in the right
But we know different and who's to argue
On such a lovely night?"

When I'm feeling weary and blue, I'm only too
Glad to be left alone
Dreaming of a place in the sun when day is done
Far from a telephone
Hardly ever see the sky
Buildings seem to grow so high
Give me somewhere peaceful and grand
Where all the land
Slumbers in monotone
I'm world weary, world weary, living in a great big town
I find it so dreary, so dreary
Everything looks grey or brown
I want an ocean blue
Great big trees
Bird's eye view of the Pyrenees
I wanna watch the moon rise up
See the great red sun go down
Watching clouds go by through a windy sky fascinates me
But if I do it in the street every cop I meet simply hates me
Because I'm world weary, world weary
Tired of all these jumping jacks
I wanna get right back to nature and relax
I'm world weary, world weary, living in a great big town
I find it so dreary, so dreary
Everything looks grey or brown
I want a horse and plow, chickens too
Just one cow with a wistful moo
A country where the verb ""to work""
Becomes a most improper noun
I can hardly wait till I see the great open spaces
My loving friends will not be there I'm so sick of their damned fool faces
Because I'm world weary, world weary
I could kiss the railroad tracks
I wanna get right back to nature
Assume a horizontal stature
I wanna get right back to nature and relax"

Her name is a pretty good start
Ultima sits in her bedroom in Texas and
Waits for her hamsters to touch
She lost her legs in a car crash three years ago
She doesn't get around much
But she is hoping someday
Somebody will take her away
Now that you got her  address you can send her
A matching attachment and face
Slick rhododendrons you make out of paper
With flowers that never lose shape
You have a video camera strapped to
Your forehead in case she is true
Smiling rewind as we die in slow motion

Don't be afraid of the dark ages darling
You may have to wait but a letter is coming
With mixes of Marilyn songs
And pictures she took at the prom
Knowing her name is enough...

Tapping for oil in veins

Is she standing in my room?”
No she’s not

She kept opening the fridge door
Looking at the mustard and the beer

Carrying her bicycle chain
And her feet worked the pedals
While her appetite steered
After that she just followed her nose
And fate is not just whose cooking smells good
But which way the wind blows
She laid down in her party dress and never got up
Needless to say she missed the party
She just got sad

She was wincing like something brittle trying hard to bend
She was numb with the terror of losing her best friend

We only see them ending

Cuz when i look at you i squint
You are that beautiful
And my pussy is a tractor
And this is a tractor pull
I'm haunted by my illicit, explicit dreams
And i can't really wake up

Like a piece of rope made out of two pieces of vine
Held together, holding each other with no one else in mind

But then I woke from the dream to realize I was alone
A tragic event, I must admit, but let's not be overblown
I'm not trying to write a love song, just a sad, pathetic moan
And maybe I just need a change, maybe I just need a new cologne
Now I look at love like being stabbed in the heart
You torture each other from day to day and then one day you part
Most of the time, it's misery, but there's some joy at the start
And for that I'd say it's worth it, just use a blade that's short and sharp on me
And if love is just a game, then how come it's no fun?
If love is just a game, how come I've never won?
I guess maybe it's possible I might be playing it wrong
And that's why every time I roll the dice, I always come undone"

Or to the atoms of which we're made, and all of whose stability we fundamentally depend on.

Where the cosmos came from? Or whether it was always there?

Mama, where's your pretty little girl tonight?
Trying to run before she can walk, that's right
She's growing up, she has a young man waiting

Wide eyes, she'll be street-wise
To the lies and the jive talk
But she'll find true love
And tenderness on the block

Daddy, don't you ask her when she's coming in
And when she's home, don't ask her where she's been
She's going out, she has a young man waiting
She's going out, can't keep her young man waiting

She'll be okay, let her have her day

It doesn't care how I play my part

Doesn't give a damn if I stand or fall

A mother was washing her baby one night
The youngest of ten and a delicate mite
The mother was poor, and the baby was thin
Twas naught but an skellington covered with skin
The mother turned 'round for a soap off the rack
She was only a moment, but a-when she turned back
Her baby had gone and in anguish she cried
""Oh, where 'as my baby gone?"" The angels replied
""Oh, your baby has gone down the plug-'ole
Oh, your baby has gone down the plug
The poor little thing was so skinny and thin
He should 'ave been washed in a jug, in a jug
Your baby is perfectly happy
He won't need a bath anymore
He's a-muckin' about with the angels above
Not lost, but gone before""

went forth every day
searching
for the author inside
and the truth outside
he first sought the protection of sleep
the protection of sheep
and a wilderness of mirrors
but what he found was incomplete
he then sought the comfort of highest text
but found only the auction of human minds
and the perversion of divine aid
he then sought to sing the body electric
and he did so eloquently
but alas, the song was no helpful piece
he then examined the corridors
of a wasteland,
believing even the poorest experiences
rich enough for the purposes
and the obscene also illustrious,
yet nothing remarkable was there
then he made way to the pulpit
because his was a heavy soul
in need of cleansing
but the masses heard him not
in fact, some say they weren’t even present
in final desperation
he decided to stop for death
but death was unable to stop for him
since he was fed with the finest
of the wheat and with honey out of the rock
thus spared, he lived on
though whether for a lifetime or a second
he knew not
since all was black….
neurons rushed madly by,
crushing order in their path
and it was then that he knew
all of it as truth.

always slant the speech

And I wait until the weekend comes
So I can clear this uselessness from my brain
I count the days until she arrives
Those precious minutes when she is mine
As we walk from my front door to her car
We are so close and alone
But that will disappear in a room filled with the warmth
Of others company
There is too much company
I hide my wounded pride and stare off into the other cars
If I could just speak the words to tell her
Exactly how I feel
I count the ways that I might say it
But I know that none of them will work because
She won't feel the same
I've come this far
But I can't go through with it because the truth would hurt

And try to make a seed grow
And I would pray for rain

6:00am, day after Christmas
I throw some clothes on in the dark
The smell of cold, car seat is freezing
The world is sleeping, I am numb

Up the stairs to her apartment
She is balled up on the couch
Her mom and dad went down to Charlotte
They're not home to find us out

And we drive
Now that I have found someone
I'm feeling more alone
Than I ever have before

She's a brick and I'm drowning slowly
Off the coast and I'm headed nowhere
She's a brick and I'm drowning slowly

They call her name at 7:30
I pace around the parking lot
Then I walk down to buy her flowers
And sell some gifts that I got

Can't you see
It's not me you're dying for?
Now she's feeling more alone
Than she ever has before

She's a brick and I'm drowning slowly
Off the coast and I'm headed nowhere
She's a brick and I'm drowning slowly

As weeks went by, it showed that she was not fine
They told me, ""Son, it's time to tell the truth""
And she broke down and I broke down
'Cause I was tired of lying

Driving back to her apartment
For the moment, we're alone
Yeah, she's alone, and I'm alone
And now I know it

She's a brick and I'm drowning slowly
Off the coast and I'm headed nowhere
She's a brick and I'm drowning slowly"

It was Don Delillo, whiskey neat
And a blinking midnight clock
Speakers on a TV stand, just a turntable to watch
When the smoke came out our mouths
On all those hooded sweatshirt walks
You were a stroke of luck
We were a goldmine and they gutted us

And from the sidelines, you see me run
Until I'm out of breath
Living the good life I left for dead
The sorrowful midwest
Well I did my best to keep my head

It was grass-stained jeans and incompletes
And a girl from class to touch
But you think about yourself too much
And you ruin who you love
Well all these claims at consciousness
My stray dog freedom
Let's have a nice clean cut
Like a bag we buy and divvy up

And from the sidelines I see you run
Until you're out of breath
And all those white lines that sped us up
We hurry to our death
Well I lagged behind, so you got ahead"

And shook the golden barley

To break the ties that bound us
And harder still to bear the shame
Of foreign chains around us

And I'll join the bold united men""

My fond arm round her flinging
When a foeman's shot burst on our ears
From out the wild woods ringing
A bullet pierced my true love's side
In life's young spring so early
And on my breast in blood she died
While soft winds shook the barley

Trying to get its taste
While I marched balking at
How I had been so rudely placed
Recommended was a bar
Where we could feel alone
Unsurrounded unadorned
Unhappy and forlorn

From the lips of sick friends
Following the sickness takes
Its own unending end

Swept over by the light
Run with dogs and wave your arms
And don't come home till night
Does everybody talk about
Another one at night
Break a button open and
Let lady see the light
All the bones were slipping out
Now I have brought me in
Never let the weakness slip
Into the trend again
One of my family has a house
She's offered me to stay
And leave the love to everyone
Whom obstacles waylay
Never take the advice
From the lips of sick friends
Rather take it turn it round
Till it suits your own ends
You can lay me out a place
It's time I had some love
Have the ladies gather round
And do me from above"

Giving all of my beautiful people everywhere a shout

Riding my own sore

To something that ? in the mid day hour

Get in a bit closer to where I should be
I know I'm supposed to let my mind ease..

Every verse that I spit is just another piece of my puzzle
And I admit
Despite all of my whit
I'm puzzled and I stay puzzling
And try to come to cript
And my church has no religion
My search has no vine

But since it ain't
I will make my own and meditate in the middle of the dangerzone

And I memorized the way our legs entwined
As I drifted off beside you

I miss, God I miss
Waking up beside you

At night I cling to you
I'm so afraid
Afraid the day will come
And I'll wake and find you gone

But you promised that you'd not abandon me
And then kissed my fears away
But I woke up to that day

But I memorized the way our eyes would meet
Reflected in the bathroom mirror
And I memorized your naked silhouette
As you slowly brushed your hair

I miss, God I miss
Waking up beside you

I've been so alone for so long
Forgot how much it hurts
To wake up so alone

But I'd memorized how warm your body felt
As you lay half asleep beside me
And I memorized the way the sunlight filled the room
And played upon your body

Is in the pocket of my old gig bag
From back when life was more soft shell
Letters littered with little lewd pictures
Drawn by the ghost of woody guthrie
Who would use you big thick hand
Just to draw one or two for me
I think of your letters as love letters
Which is how i think of songs
In that it is the writing of them
That tends to carry us along
And i danced to one of your old tunes
With my true love on our wedding day
And you voice sang the way my heart would sing
If it finally knew just what to say
Two people pulled over on the same night
To look up at the same stars
They both found their wheels were spinning
In a soft shoulder
When they both got back into their cars
And they missed fates appointed rendezvous
And then a whole lotta time wnet by
And then one day they were done
Worshipping the landscape
And they just put down their hands
And moved into the sky
They had barely said hello and it was time to say goodbye"

Sometimes in the morning
I am petrified and can't move
Awake, but cannot open my eyes
And the weight is crushing down
On my lungs, I know I can't breathe
And hope someone will save me this time
And your mother's still calling you insane and high
Swearing it's different this time
And you tell her to give in
To the demons that possess her
And that God never blessed her insides
Then you hang up the phone
And feel badly for upsetting things
Crawl back into bed to dream of a time
When your heart was open wide
And you loved things just because
Like the sick and the dying

And sometimes when you're on
You're really fucking on
And your friends, they sing along and they love you
But the lows are so extreme
That the good seems fucking cheap
And it teases you for weeks in its absence
But you'll fight and you'll make it through
You'll fake it if you have to
And you'll show up for work with a smile
And you'll be better and you'll be smarter
And more grown up and a better daughter
Or son, and a real good friend
And you'll be awake, you'll be alert
You'll be positive though it hurts
And you'll laugh and embrace all your friends
You'll be a real good listener
You'll be honest, you'll be brave

Heard voices laugh in the spirit at the
Plight of the living dead

Made it clear what they had said
""His devil's hear in a tinder-box
This dog has turned away""

It wasn't hard to find, you painted flowers on it
I guess that I was afraid that if you rolled away
You might not roll back my direction real soon

Is over ten years have gone by
And you're still mine, we're locked in time

Do you remember when we first moved in together?
The piano took up the living room
You played me boogie-woogie, I played you love songs
You'd say we're playing house, now you still say we are

We built our getaway up in a tree we found
We felt so far away, but we were still in town
Now I remember watching that old tree burn down
I took a picture that I don't like to look at

Rocky burned up the movie screen
When I was turning seventeen
Tie-dyed shirts and Levi jeans
Looking cool at the Dairy Queen
Trying to impress a young woman in her Sunday dress

That was 1976, didn't know who I was yet
A pretty little blonde-haired girl
Stole my heart and changed my world
Two kids and a moonlite sky
A little love on a Friday night
Built a fire that just won't quit
And that was 1976

My high-school days are packed away
Set my sights on a bigger stage
Jimmy Carter moved to D.C
A Georgia boy just like me
Life seemed easy, nothing much that we needed

That was 1976, didn't know who I was yet
A pretty little blonde-haired girl
Stole my heart and changed my world
Two kids and a moonlite sky
A little love on a Friday night
Built a fire that just won't quit
And that was 1976

Eight-track tapes were still in style
And Elvis was still alive
Wonder Woman sure looked fine
Bionic Man was still prime time
And that girl I liked
We kept on trying till we got it right

That was 1976, didn't know who I was yet

As each day crashed around him the future stood revealed
He was turning into his parents

His hairline receding, the slight overbite
He picked up the razor to begin his shaving
And thought, ""Oh I wish I was different""

I wish I didn't have this nose
These ears that stick out remind me of my father
And I don't want to be reminded at all

And with a quick swipe lopped off his nose
And happy with that he made a slice where his chin was
He's always wanted a dimple, the end of all illusion
Then peering down straight between his legs
Harry thought of the range of possibilities
A new face, a new life, no memories of the past
And slit his throat from ear to ear

Yesterday, it seemed my life
Was colder than December
All alone I watched the eagles fly
Even the light seemed to have changed
In the Californian sky

Through all of those battles then you came
Stepped out of the fading light
Said, ""Baby I'm American, dry your eyes again
Because I'm here to save your life""

My American Angel
Doesn't want to fight (doesn't need to fight)
My U.S of Angel (Angel)
Holds me in the dead of night
Takes away that fear that I carried forever
You stopped to wipe away my tears
But you stayed forever amore
And more, didn't you baby?

Because I don't think that I could love and lose again
I don't think I have the strength

Contrasting the snow

Shoveling coal inside my dreams

And drag that chain across the state

And piece by piece, these brief eventualities
Would reap of thee, in feats flung far from me—

And the mountains shook
You'd see a million colors

Her curtain spreads quicker
The safety's off
But the gun has no trigger

Distance, justice, power
You'd glimpse the password
You wouldn't need the book
You'd own both slave and master

But now the banks all closed
And nothing gets bigger
The crowd will yell
But the gun has no trigger

If you had looked, you might reconsider
Or just maybe you already have
They watch you sleeping
You watch their garbage cook
You'd weep a bowl of tears
If you had looked

But now the gate comes down
The pangs are growing dimmer

Crumpled and puffy faced
Dead in the stare of a thousand miles

We live so high above the ground, satellites surround us
I am humbled in this city
There seems to be an endless sea of people like us
Wakeful dreamers, I pass them on the sunlit streets
In our rooms filled with laughter
We make hope from every small disaster
Everybody says ""you can't, you can't, you can't, don't try.""
Still everybody says that if they had the chance they'd fly like we do"

They don't care about you and me, obviously
No not us, we're the mountain people
So far away from those tree-lined streets
Look so neat, not for us
No fat chance, we're the mountain people

They'll seek us in the valley
They'll seek us on the plain
They own the milk and runny honey
And they're not quite the same, and we

Live together under fantasy oak trees
In the dark, we make sparks
So unique, we're the mountain people
Curiosity comes to plead with me
Vanity strangles me, pulls me
Shakes me down, we're the mountain people

Dig the peat, pile it high
Let it dry, one last chance at ignorance
No fat chance, we're the mountain people


One short blast was followed by two longer ones
Short blast, long blast
Coming from the outcast
Put me in a deep freeze
And I'll sneeze, with the mountain people
From a distance I can see them
Pacing (marching) upstream
Slowly, ruthlessly, and then steady
Nets and cages, open, ready

Soothes me, worry me
Take me, break me

A deep freeze put me in it and I'll sneeze

And her dad called himself commander-in-chief

But I knew the sense of worthlessness she'd have to rise above

She had a dream, woke up in shock
She had seen her own body outlined in chalk
I split the scene, the globe'd been spun
And her ghost leaned down to kiss me

Shone a new way, yeah (New way, new way)

Even when you're ghost (Follow down and seem)
And I can feel your every single move (I, who watched this disappear)

So, good morning (And out of the dark you'll find you)

If you wonder why your frown sits along on the ground
Just look around at what you've been without
And just because I wear it long it started being wrong
And it's been too long since you opened your mouth
Then you get to wondering why it took so long to find
There's just one thing you can't do without
You better stand up and shout
If you're feeling satisfied don't make it stay inside
It's time you tried to let it all out
Stand up and shout
When your head is feeling light and everything is right
And you don't know what the fight is all about
Stand up and shout
When you get to thinking things you never thought before
Then you'll know, without a doubt
Come on and stand up and shout
Well all right

Close the door and lock the time
Jump over the wall
On the other side

I pull the covers
Over my head
Black velvet darkness
Above my bed
It's beyond what I've seen or read
Now I know why I thank the days"

quiet;;Calm and Peaceful;Calm and Peaceful;"Those who restrain desire, do so because theirs is weak enough to be restrained and the restrainer of reason usurps its place & governs the unwilling.
And being restrain'd it by degrees becomes passive till it is only the shadow of desire.
The history of this written in Paradise Lost, & the Governor of Reason is call'd Messiah.
And the original Archangel or possessor of the command of the heavenly host, is call'd the Devil or Satan and his children are call'd Sin & Death.
But in the Book of Job Miltons Messiah is call'd Satan.
For this history has been adopted by both parties.
It indeed appear'd to Reason as if Desire was cast out, but the Devils account is that the Messiah (Plate 6) fell, & formed a heaven of what he stole from the Abyss.
This is shewn in the Gospel, where he prays to the Father to send the comforter or Desire that Reason may have Ideas to build on, the Jehovah of the Bible being no other than he who dwells in flaming fire.
Know that after Christs death, he became Jehovah.
But in Milton' the Father is Destiny, the Son, a Raio of the five senses, & the Holy-ghost, Vacuum!
Note. The reason Milton wrote in fetters when he wrote of Angels & God, and at liberty when of Devils & Hell, is because he was a true Poet and of the Devils party without knowing it."

Well, I held you like a lover
Happy hands and your elbow
In the appropriate place

Happy plans, for that delicate look
Upon your face

Hurting parts of your garden
With no room for a pardon
In a place where no one knows
What we have done

Do you come
Together ever with him?
And is he dark enough
Enough to see your light?
And do you brush your teeth before you kiss?
Do you miss my smell?
And is he bold enough to take you on?
Do you feel like you belong?
And does he drive you wild?
Or just mildly free?
What about me?

Well, you held me like a lover
Sweaty hands, and my foot
In the appropriate place
And we use cushions to cover
Happy glands in the mild issue
Of our disgrace
Our minds pressed and guarded
While our flesh disregarded
The lack of space for the light-hearted
In the boom that beats our drum
I know I make you cry
And I know sometimes you wanna die
But do you really feel alive without me?
If so, be free
If not, leave him for me
Before one of us has
Accidental babies
For we are in love

It was a long hot day
At the end of the summer
I had a chill in my heart
Like the start of the winter
And I didn’t know what to wear
I wasn’t sure what to say
I was standing alone at the tail of the river

Dive into me
Into the raging sea
Follow your heart
Down where it’s deep and it’s dark
Dive into me
Into the healing sea
Put your life into my hands and take a chance
And dive into me

So we loaded up the car
Drove deep into the mountain
Where the river was borne in time’s holy fountain
And we spoke over how it ran
All the way to the ocean
Trusting its path to a natural motion

Dive into me (Dive into me)
Into the raging sea (Dive into me)
Follow your heart
Down where it’s deep and it’s dark
Dive into me (Dive into me)
Into the healing sea (Dive into me)
Put your life into my hands and take a chance
And dive into me

Sometimes swirling waters drag you down
Knowing how to swim doesn’t mean you’ll never drown
Come the storm you hold in fear
Whoever’s by your side
Sometimes you’re just drifting on the tide

Dive into me (Dive into me)
Into the raging sea (Dive into me)
Follow your heart
Down where it’s deep and it’s dark
Dive into me (Dive into me)
Into the healing sea (Dive into me)
Put your life into my hands and take a chance
And dive into me"

We said how rich we were and how warm we felt with a cognac heart
Talked over women in a lonely voice and began to jive
All the men are hungry, all the men are in search of time
Was in a scene from 'Death In The Afternoon' when I almost cried
I realized papa wanted me to live in his bull ring life
It made me hungry for peace and it made me wild and it tore my heart
It didn't help to wipe away the fears like he often claimed
All the men are hungry, all the men are in search of time
Was in a frenzy from the midnight air when I saw the light
I realized only children can live upon a timeless flight
It made me hungry for youth and it made me sad, and it made me kind of laugh

Her heart is oh so tired now

She sold then stole right back
The vanity, insanity her hungry heart forgave

Behold the famous groupies, they are alike as two peas
And where the other goes, the other goes
But though the famous groupies are only paid in rupees
Nobody knows what the famous groupies know
And nobody goes where the famous groupies go

Of Dunlopillo mattress in his van
But when the famous groupies arrived with their twin snoopies
Nobody saw which way the poor boy ran
As nobody does it like a famous groupie can

Who used to practice voodoo on the side
But when the famous twosome suggested something gruesome
All that they found was a crater two miles wide
Which left the music business absolutely horrified

Tuesday afternoon
I'm just beginning to see, now I'm on my way
It doesn't matter to me, chasing the clouds away
Something, calls to me
The trees are drawing me near, I've got to find out why
Those gentle voices I hear, explain it all with a sigh


I'm looking at myself reflections of my mind
It's just the kind of day to leave myself behind
So gently swaying through the fairyland of love
If you'll just come with me you'll see the beauty of
Tuesday afternoon, Tuesday afternoon

Her legs around me, in the morning I cried

Leave me to die, you won't remember my voice

Water, quench my human thirst
Ashes, take me back to earth
Water, quench my human thirst
My bones soaked in the icy cold
And fixed me where I lay
Until each vessel left the shore
And made a line for me
There never was a breeze
The leaves were silent all that day
They say the sails were ghosts
That stole the wind to set them free
I lay transfixed
Felt nothing but the beating of my fear
As flames rose up and swallowed whole
Greatest of the fleet
The others circled round
And I heard chanting fill the air
The ashes lifted high
Were falling back into the sea
Ashes, take me back to earth
Water, quench my human thirst

I lit a thin green candle
To make you jealous of me
But the room just filled up with mosquitos
They heard that my body was free
Then I took the dust of a long sleepless night
And I put it in your little shoe
And then I confess that I tortured the dress
That you wore for the world to look through

I showed my heart to the doctor
He said I just have to quit
Then he wrote himself a prescription
And your name was mentioned in it
Then he locked himself in a library shelf
With the details of our honeymoon
And I hear from the nurse that he's gotten much worse
And his practice is all in a ruin

I heard of a saint who had loved you
So I studied all night in his school
He taught that the duty of lovers
Is to tarnish the golden rule
And just when I was sure that his teachings were pure
He drowned himself in the pool
His body is gone, but back here on the lawn
His spirit continues to drool

An Eskimo showed me a movie
He'd recently taken of you
The poor man could hardly stop shivering
His lips and his fingers were blue
I suppose that he froze when the wind took your clothes
And I guess he just never got warm
But you stand there so nice in your blizzard of ice
Oh, please let me come into the storm"

And yesterday I followed secret trails inside my heart
And I can't let this fall apart
I will not slip into their world

And in my starlit sky she's flying
And in my garden green she's flirting with the fairies
Over the kingdom wall she's climbing

Last script writer, y’all ain’t rappers or dick riders
Tryna call my click spider there’s none higher that I admire
Throw ‘em up with their shoes tied over the wires
We’re tired, stop in the long road, harder than the pavement
I shake shift, that’s why Kali Holmes ain’t got basements
Face it, I’m a threat to your era
Bifocals I need just to see this shit clearer
That feelin’, you feel the sense of danger gettin’ nearer
I’m Jack so pay close to the perception from the mirror
Open caps for the chips like Pringles
I put hits on your man just like some flippers
I got funk in the champ and while it lingers
I keep my hands in that cheese, we call it Cheeto fingers

See me creepin’, be up in the spot with somethin’ decent
Another day, another dollar, yea another reason
Body bags, ice duffle for me to put the cheese in
When it come to that pork we put the greeze in
Easy off the flake pedal and start breazin’
I’m like the wind, light is pliff, I’m ridin’ gemstone
No key shuffle in the end zone
First of all, we the one and only, others is phony
Double G cronies, way I but ‘em in the head
If they don’t come up with my bread I leave ‘em dead and lonely
Just a satisfactory snack on categories
Rap rap on the track like a laboratory rat
Now how real is that?
My cup on the dover with dope, I spill the crack

Drive awayjust get on the Interstate
And slip through this closing gate
Pulled into this cheap hotel
I called just to wish you well
You said don't let love break you down
Just show me how and let me never be broken

Tomorrow a new point of view
These white lights will bend to make blue
Now this can all look new to you

Are you still living there
Walking the streets with your hollow stare
You say there's loneliness everywhere
So we have nothing to lose
The music plays all day long
And sorrow looks beautiful
And lovers seem mystical
(Lonely sorrow)

Tomorrow a new point of view
These bright lights will bend to make blue
Now this can all look new to you

Tomorrow a new point of view
These white lights will bend to make blue
Now this can all look new to you"

Somethin' tells me, somethin' tells me
Somethin' tells me you can read my mind
Somethin' tells me, somethin' tells me
Somethin' tells me you can read my mind

Somethin' tells me you can read my mind
Your brain is callin' to me one more time

Your brain, your brain
Your brain is callin' to me one more time
Your brain, your brain
Your brain is callin' to me one more time
You're good

You push, push, push
So good
You push, push, push

witty;;Humor and Playfulness;Positive Sentiments;"We were strangers
Who once were lovers
We've been everlasting friends
I was shattered
When you walked out, boy
I was walking off the edge
Friends, said I looked so down-hearted
When you left
Now my broken heart is stable
I'm starting to mend
Got you back and I'm living again
Oh, this must be love
That sets my soul on fire
A supernatural love
(this must be)
That makes my flame burn higher
A supernatural love
Life was only tear drops falling down
From my eyes
Now my broken heart is stable
Oh, I'm coming alive
I can't fight what I'm feeling inside
This must be love
That sets my soul on fire
A supernatural love
(oh, this must be)
That makes my flame burn higher
A supernatural love
That gets me so excited
A supernatural love
(oh, this must be)
That makes us true survivors
A supernatural love
Friends, said I looked so down-hearted
When, when you left
Now my broken heart is stable
I'm starting to mend
Got you back and I'm living again
Oh, this must be love
That sets my soul on fire
A supernatural love
(oh, this must be)
That makes my flame burn higher
A supernatural love
That gets me so excited
A supernatural love
(oh, this must be)
That makes us true survivors
A supernatural love"

My Stomach Filled With Butterflies
My Dream Was All Bout' A Love Affair
It Was Beautiful Cause You Were The One Right There
I Look Up Just To Check The Time
Cause You Bounce From Work After 5
I Know Your J-O-Be Hard On You
So I Wanna Scoop You Up And Tell You What I Wanna Do
Take You On A Ride, Like A Rollercoaster
Make You Wanna Say Whoaa...
Have You Feelin' Right, Getting' Kinda Vocal
Make You Wanna Say Whoaa...
All Day, I Was Fantasizing
Can't Say Much, Cause Some Of It's Classified
Till Tonite When We Both Will Share
In The Moment When You Tell Me Just To Hold It Right There
When You Talk, You're Deeper Than An Ocean
A Woman, With Complex Emotions
Just Love To Peel Off All Your Layers
You Got So Many Delicious Flavors
Satisfactions, Waitin' For Ya', You'll Relax Like, You're Supposed Ta'
When I Finally Put My Hands To You, I Blow Your Mind With Some Thangs You Never Knew
Hope You're Not Working, Real Late Cause, All This Talk Got Me, So Anxious
Can't Wait To Play In Your Amusement Park, We're Gonna Sway And Whoa Into The Dark....
Take You On A Ride, Like A Rollercoaster

Make You Wanna Say Whoaa..."
